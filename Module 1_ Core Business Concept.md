5. Prioritize business value over technical implementation details
6. Create diagrams where appropriate to illustrate concepts

### 📊 Output Sections

1. **Business Name Analysis**
   - Analyze the current business name for effectiveness
   - Suggest 3-5 alternative names if appropriate, explaining the rationale
   - Recommend the strongest name option and explain why

2. **Elevator Pitch**

     - Who it serves
     - The unique value it provides
     - How it differs from alternatives

3. **Industry Category**
   - Identify the primary and secondary industry categories this business belongs to
   - Explain why these categorizations are appropriate
   - Note any cross-industry positioning that creates unique opportunities

4. **Value Proposition**
   - Define the core value proposition in clear, customer-focused terms
   - Explain what specific problem is being solved and why it matters to customers
   - Highlight the key benefits customers will receive

   Example diagram:
```mermaid
graph LR
       A[Customer Need] --> [Your Solution]
       B --> [Key Benefit 1]
       B --> [Key Benefit 2]
       B --> [Key Benefit 3]
   ```

5. **Inspiration Sources**

       - Include 5-7 key touchpoints from initial awareness to ongoing relationship
       - For each step, briefly note the user's goal and the business's objective

       Format:
       1. [Step 1]: [User goal] → [Business objective]
       2. [Step 2]: [User goal] → [Business objective]
       And so on...

       Create a Mermaid.js diagram showing the customer journey flow.
       Example:
```mermaid
       flowchart LR

       - Create a compelling Million Dollar Message following this formula:
         "I help [TARGET AUDIENCE] achieve/do [GOAL/SOLUTION], so they can [DESIRED RESULT] without [PAIN POINT] in [TIMEFRAME]."

       The message should be:
       - Crisp and not overly wordy
       - Focused on customer outcomes, not features
       - Specific and compelling
       - Resonant with the target audience

       Provide the final message and a brief explanation of why it's effective.
