## Make A Video Script

I want you to write a video script for Facebook ads based on the problem aware avatar’s diary entry. Pretend you are an A-list copywriter. Describe all the same emotions, doubts, & beliefs as the avatar. Use the following to create your script:

### Stage 1: Pattern Interrupt  
Grab the user’s attention in the first 20 seconds.  
This can be done in one of six ways. Pick which one you think is best based on the problem aware avatar:  
- A: The avatar is moving toward a pleasure / benefit  
- B: The avatar is moving away from a pain  
- C: Leverage the curiosity bias  
- D: Open with a testimonial from an actual customer of the company making the offer  
- E: Use an uncommon statistic related to the problem, and make it seem shocking  

### Stage 2: Position & Tell Story  
Build authority & give a reason to watch the ad fully through.

- **Part A: Position**  
Make this less than 20 seconds. Establish “what’s in it for me” for the viewer.

- **Part B: Story**  
Make this less than 2 minutes. Give the viewer a valuable insight about their pain or desired benefit.

### Stage 3: Offer  
Give a direct and actionable offer with a call to action.

**Notes for the script:**  
This is a first-person script. It will be voiced by the actual owner of the business. The tone should be relaxed and conversational. They should seem like someone actually trying to help the audience.  

**Give me a hook variation for each of the types given in Stage 1 above.**

## AIDA - Testimonial

I want you to rewrite the AIDA ad output above. This time, I want you to make it from the perspective of a testimonial from a mom that is similar to the problem aware avatar. This mom actually came into [customer], and is talking about her experience, in the context of the AIDA ad writing framework.  

The output should be from the 3rd person perspective. The testimonial is from a [audience] named **[name]**.  

The "Attention" section of the ad should be a fictitious quote from **[name]** talking about their experience.
