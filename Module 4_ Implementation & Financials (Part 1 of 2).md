### 2. Implementation Roadmap

a) **Timeline & Phases**
   - Create a detailed roadmap with specific phases:
     - Pre-launch (setup, testing)
     - Launch phase (initial roll-out)
     - Growth phase (scaling operations)
     - Optimization phase (improving efficiency)

   Example diagram:
   ```mermaid
   gantt
       title Implementation Timeline
       dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
       section Setup Phase
       Company registration     :a1, 2023-06-01, 30d
       Initial team hiring      :a2, after a1, 45d
       MVP development          :a3, after a1, 60d
       section Launch Phase
       Alpha testing            :b1, after a3, 30d
       Beta testing             :b2, after b1, 30d
       Public launch            :milestone, after b2, 0d
       section Growth Phase
       Marketing campaign       :c1, after b2, 90d
       Additional hiring        :c2, after b2, 60d
