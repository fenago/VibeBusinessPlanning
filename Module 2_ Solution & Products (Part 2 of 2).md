## 📓 LLM Instructions

> **INSTRUCTIONS:** Continue developing the solution and product strategy from Part 1

### 🔝 Process

1. Review the solution strategy defined in Part 1
2. Focus on gamification elements, delivery mechanisms, and value proposition details
3. Ensure all aspects align with the core business concept
4. Prioritize user engagement and retention strategies
5. Create practical delivery mechanisms suited to the product types
6. Use diagrams where appropriate to illustrate concepts

### 📊 Output Sections (Continued)

3. **Gamification Strategy**

   a) **Engagement Elements**
      - Identify 3-5 gamification elements to increase user engagement
      - For each element:
        - Element name: [Name of gamification element]
        - Description: [How it works]
        - Purpose: [What behavior it encourages]
        - Implementation: [How it's integrated into products/services]
      
      Focus on elements that align with the avatar's motivations and goals

   b) **Retention Mechanisms**
      - Describe 3-5 specific mechanisms to encourage ongoing engagement
      - For each mechanism:
