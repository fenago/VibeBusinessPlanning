## Tips for Best Results

1. **Complete modules sequentially** - Each module builds on the previous one
2. **Process multi-part modules in order** - For modules split into parts, complete them in numerical order
3. **Combine multi-part modules before proceeding** - Always combine all parts of a module before moving to the next module
4. **Be specific in your inputs** - The more detail you provide, the better the outputs
5. **Review outputs carefully** - Make adjustments if needed before proceeding to the next module
6. **Save all outputs** - Keep a complete record of each module's results
7. **Focus on visuals** - Pay attention to the Mermaid.js diagrams for visual understanding
8. **Iterate if needed** - You can run modules again with refined inputs if results need improvement
9. **Share with stakeholders** - Use the outputs to gather feedback from potential partners or investors
