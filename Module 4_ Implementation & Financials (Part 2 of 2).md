## 📊 Output Sections

### 1. Detailed Financial Models

a) **Profit & Loss Projections**
   - Create a 3-year P&L statement including:
     - Revenue (by product/service line)
     - COGS
     - Gross margin
     - Operating expenses (detailed categories)
     - EBITDA
     - Net profit
   
   Example P&L visualization:
   ```mermaid
   %%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#5D8AA8'}}}%%
   xychart-beta
       title "Profit & Loss Forecast"
       x-axis ["Year 1", "Year 2", "Year 3"]
       y-axis "Amount ($K)" 0 -->  1200
       bar [600, 900, 1200]
       bar [450, 650, 850]
       bar [150, 250, 350]
       legend ["Revenue", "Expenses", "Profit"]
   ```

b) **Cash Flow Projections**
   - Create a 3-year cash flow forecast including:
     - Operating cash flow
     - Investing cash flow
     - Financing cash flow
     - Beginning cash balance
     - Ending cash balance

c) **Balance Sheet Forecast**
   - Project your balance sheet for 3 years, detailing:
     - Assets (current and non-current)
     - Liabilities (current and long-term)
     - Equity

d) **Financial Ratios**
   - Calculate critical financial ratios:
     - Profitability (gross margin, net margin)
     - Liquidity (current ratio, quick ratio)
     - Efficiency (inventory turnover, asset turnover)
     - Valuation metrics

### 2. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

a) **Risk Matrix**
   - Identify and evaluate potential risks:
     - Market risks
     - Operational risks
     - Financial risks
     - Competitive risks
     - Regulatory risks
   
   Example risk matrix:
   ```mermaid
   quadrantChart
       title Risk Assessment Matrix
       x-axis Low Impact -->  High Impact
       y-axis Low Probability -->  High Probability
       quadrant-1 "Monitor"
       quadrant-2 "High Priority"
       quadrant-3 "Low Priority"
       quadrant-4 "Contingency Plan"
       "Supplier Disruption": [0.7, 0.6]
       "Competitor Entry": [0.8, 0.8]
       "Regulatory Change": [0.9, 0.3]
       "Technology Failure": [0.6, 0.9]
       "Economic Downturn": [0.5, 0.7]
   ```

b) **Mitigation Strategies**
   - For each high-priority risk, develop specific mitigation strategies:
     - Preventive measures
     - Contingency plans
     - Response protocols
     - Risk transfer mechanisms

c) **Scenario Analysis**
   - Model multiple business scenarios:
     - Base case (expected outcome)
     - Best case (optimistic scenario)
     - Worst case (pessimistic scenario)
   - Show financial impact of each scenario

### 3. Key Performance Indicators

a) **Financial KPIs**
   - Establish key financial metrics to track success:
     - Revenue metrics (growth rate, LTV, ARPU)
     - Cost metrics (CAC, burn rate)
     - Profitability metrics (margins, breakeven)
     - Cash flow metrics (runway, cash conversion)

b) **Operational KPIs**
   - Define operational metrics for monitoring:
     - Customer metrics (acquisition, churn, NPS)
     - Product metrics (usage, engagement)
     - Marketing metrics (conversion, CAC:LTV)
     - Team metrics (productivity, capacity)

c) **KPI Dashboard Design**
   - Create a dashboard framework for tracking all KPIs
