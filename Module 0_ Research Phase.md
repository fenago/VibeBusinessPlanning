    2. If URLs are provided, extract key information from those sources
    3. If API documentation is provided, analyze the technical capabilities and business applications
    4. Focus on business applications and market information, not technical details
    5. Organize your findings in a structured format
    6. Keep your research focused and relevant to business planning
    7. Create visual diagrams using Mermaid.js where appropriate to illustrate concepts
    8. Format all output as a well-structured Markdown document
    
    ### Research Output:
    
    Please provide your research findings in the following sections, formatted in Markdown:
